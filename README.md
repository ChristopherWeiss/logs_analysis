# LOGS_ANALYSIS Project
Welcome to my third Udacity project for the Full Stack Program. A program that will take several lines of code and
return information provided in the logs_analysis.py code. This database contains newspaper articles, as well as the web server log for the site. 

**Install**
* We assume that you are familiar with SQL and Python. 
* You will need to install the two following programs before running the code. 

* You will need install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* You will also need to install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
	*From your terminal run the command 'Vagrant up' to install the Linix OS. Once completed run vagrant ssh.
	*Once this is completed run the '/vagrant' command as directed. 
*Move the LOGS_analysis folder into the vagrant folder on your machine.


**Runing the program**
* Once you've installed Virtual Box and Vagrant on your computer, moved LOGS_analysis folder and the newsdata.sql files into the Vagrant folder, started Vagrant in your terminal, move into the LOGS_analysis folder in the terminal.
* Type python logs_analysis.py to pull the information directed from the logs_analysis.py file.

### Have fun
I enjoyed making this project and hope you enjoy what I've put together.
